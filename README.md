# CSharpCommon

A C# common library for bootstrapping and jump starting projects of any framework (on .NET).

## Audience

The intended audience are folks who are designing applications or have experience in starting up console/web apps from scratch.  Being knowledgable of the following is recommended:

1. .NET 6 / 7 & 8 - Preferrably all 3 but at least 7 or 8 is best or a deep understanding of 6 if you haven't gotten there yet.
2. An understanding of Onion Architecture and general programming design principles like SOLID as well as object design principles.  Read the books "Design Patterns" and "Clean Architecture".

## Purpose

Spend less time on the infrastructure and more time on the project's code.  We're reinventing the wheel all the time for lower level handling and this project tries to minimize some of that by offering some often used algorithms close to .NET standards and recommended code conventions.

## Style

This project adheres to the .NET standard code styling for the project found here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md

## Clean Code

This project emphasizes "Clean Code" conventions.  There's a lot of boiler plate code handled, particularly in unit/integration testing projects and this project helps clean up the eye sore that can evolve with complex mocking and transaction based testing on databases.
